<%block name="description">
		<p>
x86 GCC 4 Hybrid is an unsupported variant, as it uses GCC 4 as the main compiler and
assumes GCC 2 objects to be contained in a gcc2 subdirectory. It is provided for
development and testing purposes only. Releasing software that requires these
unsupported builds is discouraged.
